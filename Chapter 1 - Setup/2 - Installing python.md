# Installing Python
While this is quite a simple task to do i will help step you through it to make sure that you select the right options to prevent future issues. you can download Python from [The official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/), or you can click this link to install [3.8.5](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.5/python-3.8.5.exe)
