# Python-Tutorial
This Repo will aim to help you learn python. Below is a list of changes to the file. The content of this course is a mix of my own (ath0rus's) knowledge and Material from other websites which their links will be in the [Links file](Links.md).

### Note
If you see a folder called .vscode it is simply there to allow users of VSCode (Insiders or standard edition) to auto run python files. if you are not using VSCode (Insiders or standard edition) ignore .vscode.
