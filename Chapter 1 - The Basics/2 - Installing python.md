While this is quite a simple task to do i will help step you through it to make sure that you select the right options to prevent future issues. you can download Python from [The official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/), or you can click this link to install [3.8.5](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.5/python-3.8.5.exe)

Once you find the .exe file in your downloads folder or where you saved it. Open it. you will then se a similar app to this, [install](https://github.com/ath0rus/Python-Tutorial/blob/Additional-work/Chapter%201%20-%20The%20Basics/Chapter%201%20Resourses/Photos/Install%201.jpg)
