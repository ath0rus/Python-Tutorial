# Installing VSC

VSC (short for Visual Studio Code) is a free text editor made by Microsoft that can edit many languages including Python, Html, C++, C, Etc...
using Extensions (mostly free). In this doccument we will focus on installing and setting up VSC with python. Then in the next doccument we will write and run our first code.

To install VSC visit the [Official Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Or here are some handy quick install links (You will be re-directed to their website and the download will automatically start)

### Standard Edition
[Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win64user)\
[Mac OS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win64user)\
[Linux.deb](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=linux64_deb)\
[Linux.rpm](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_rhel-fedora-and-centos-based-distributions)

### Insiders Edition
[Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win64user&build=insiders) (This is the one i use)\
[Mac OS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=osx&build=insiders)\
[Linux.deb](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=linux64_deb&build=insiders)\
[Linux.rpm](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=linux64_rpm&build=insiders)

### Other download options
[Other](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads)

Follow the below steps to install VSC for Windows. I will not cover how to do it in Mac OS or Linux, But the process is similar. VSC is also portable so it can be installed on a USB, However i will not cover the process of Installing VSC on a USB

## Instalation process
Once you download VSC run the installer
1. Click "I Accept..." than next
2. You may be prompted to pick an install location. just leave it as is or navigate to where you want it installed.
3. Make sure that all the boxes under the ["other"](https://github.com/ath0rus/Python-Tutorial/blob/Additional-work/Chapter%201%20-%20The%20Basics/Chapter%201%20Resourses/Photos/Other%20Options.jpg) tab are selected. You can also choose to add a desktop icon, which i advise but its not required for the software to work.
4. click "Next" and then "Install"
5. You have now installed VSC

## Setting up the python Extension
1. When you have VSC opened look the the left side of the app for the "Extensions" tab Highlighted white in this [screenshot](https://github.com/ath0rus/Python-Tutorial/blob/Additional-work/Chapter%201%20-%20The%20Basics/Chapter%201%20Resourses/Photos/Extensions.jpg)
2. Search for python
3. Click "Install". [My Screenshot](https://github.com/ath0rus/Python-Tutorial/blob/Additional-work/Chapter%201%20-%20The%20Basics/Chapter%201%20Resourses/Photos/Python%20Extension.jpg) shows the module greyed out but it will look different for you
4. If it says "Reload Required" click that and VSC will re open itself and activiate the extension. Note: VSC Insiders usually do not need to "Reload" to activiate the Extension
5. Finished!

You now have Python ready to go Inside of VSC. Throught the rest of the documments i will be using VSC Insiders to run the code, But both version of VSC are neally identical.
