### The Print command
This command is a very simple yet very useful command, If at any stage you want the code to print out what it is doing or want the code to have a custom error code you use the print command. while you can't type "Print" into the console (the place where the code runs) and get an output, you can use "print" to get the code to print out anything at any stage.

#### How does it work
well its simple, here it is.

```python
print('Hello World')
```

Lets break that down. "print" is the command (has to be lowercase), the Brackets () are required since python 2.7 and the print function won't work without them. Now i have used ' (Apostrophys) but you can do it with " (Quotation marks) it dosen't matter. some functions we will talk abou tlater will require " and not '. the code above will output this.
```python
Hello World
```
