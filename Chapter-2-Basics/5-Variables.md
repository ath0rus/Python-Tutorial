# Variables

Variables are a (semi) essential part of python, You can think of them as a box that can only store 1 item at a time. you give the box a name and you can store something in it,
But when you go to put something else in it you replace what is already in it. Basically its a 1 in 1 out system, But with lists and dictionaries you can store more than 1 
variable at a time.

defining a variable is simple, You take the name, Lets say x and make it equal something. An example of this is
```python
x = 234
print(x)
```
you may have noticed there that i used the Integer data type and then printed it out. 234 is called the value of x. now the value of x could have been any data type in python.
this can come in handy as it allow you to "store" data temproarily and have it discarded when the code ends or is closed. The Varible is stored in the devices RAM.

Note: When you name a Variable you can't start the name with a number. it has to be a letter or _. A full python style guide can be found [Here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
