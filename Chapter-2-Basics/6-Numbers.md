# Numbers
Numbers, They are great and get used alot in python. From counting things, doing maths and just being displayed. 

As mentioned in [Data Types](4-Data-types.md) there are 3 types of numbers. Int, Complex, Float. Personally when ever i am writting code in python i usually use int's. 
An example of how to use numbers is: 
```python
x = 5
print(x)
```
You don't even need to define it as a variable
```python
print(5)
```
It is that easy to use numbers. Converting numbers to stings or strings to numbers is commonly used with numbers.
