# Operators
I have shown operators before when we talked about [Specifying variable types](7-Specifying-variable-types-simple.md). Operators are used in python to do both simple and complicated maths. [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp) lists most of the operators you can use in python. I have made a list of the ones that i frequently use.

>| Symbol/ Operator | Name | Example |
>|------------------|------|---------|
>|+| Plus | 50 + 10 |
>|-| Minus | 10 - 5 |
>|*| Multiplication | 10 * 2 |
>|/| Division | 100 / 2 |

Without These and many more othe symbols, Doing maths in python would be very hard and maybe imposible.

### Other Operators
Symbols aren't just the only Operators in python. you can have:

>| Symbol/ Operator | Name |
>|------------------|------|
>|&| AND |
>|\|| OR |

While thats only 2 of the operators there are many more operators that you can use. Another important thing to know is that with the likes of if, and, or. You can use the Words instead of the symbol.
