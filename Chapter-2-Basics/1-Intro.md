# Intro
Python code may get confusing as it is complicated and there alot of stuff to learn when you are getting started, 
But the point of these tutorial doccuments is to help you understand python, and write Python code easily and effectivly. While my methods of coding may not be the best or most 
effective. That is what works with me. In no way is my method the be all an end all of ways to code, and i encourage you to play around, experiment and deviate from these doccuments. 
Throught the rest of the doccuments and chapters i will be taking inspiration from some of the websites in the [Links file](../Links.md).

Right thats enough of an intro lets get into some python in the next Doccument
