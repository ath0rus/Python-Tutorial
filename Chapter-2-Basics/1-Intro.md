# Your First Code
Python code may get confusing as it is complicated and there alot of stuff to learn when you are getting started, 
But the point of these tutorial doccuments is to help you understand python and write code easily and effectivly. While my methods of coding may not be the best or most effective
that is what works with me. In no way is my method the be all an end all of ways to code. Throught the rest of the doccuments and chapters
i will be taking parts from [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp) and [Techwittim.net](https://techwithtim.net/tutorials/python-programming/)
Right thats enough of an intro lets get into some python in the next Doccument

## The rest of this doccument is still currently being developed

What to read next: [Starting in python](), [Updates to these doccuments]()
