# Booleans
Booleans or often called Bool/s. A bool is a True or False value. This can be used to set a values state. Than you can check a vlause state to see if it is True or False and then do specific actions based on the output. Bools are typically used at the start of while loops. 
```python
while x = True:
    Print('Hello')
```
I will cover while loops later on.
