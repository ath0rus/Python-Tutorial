# Data types

There are several data types within python and they all get used in different ways. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp) talks about each data type
and how they are used. That is a good web page to read as it tells you what you need to know, But i will simplify it for you here in the aims to make more sense of it.

### List of python Data types and how they are used
>- Text: str
>- Numbers: int, float, complex

Quote from [w3chools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp)

For now these are all the data types that you need to know. There are pleanty more but these are a good starting point

### Int, Complex, Float
1. An Int is a whole number e.g 34 
2. A complex is a mix of numbers and letters but not in string form.
3. A float is an int but with a decimal point e.g 45.5

### String
A string is any character surrounded by " " or ' '

Theses below data types we will cover in more detail in later doccuments

### Lists
Lists are a special data type they allow you to store mutliple variables in a "list"

### Tuple
A tuple is almost i dentical to a list but its has some slight differnces

### dict (aka Dictionary)
A Dict is a Key Value pair styled list. 

### bool (Boolean)
Accepts only 2 values: True or False. These can be used inside of a Dictionary

Thre are many more to cover but that will be left for another doccument.
